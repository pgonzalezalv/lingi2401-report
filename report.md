# LINGI2401 - Open Source strategy for software development #

## Day 1 - 2018-09-25 ##

Today I went to the [Open Source strategy for software development][2401] class.

We have to choose an open source project we which to contribute to. The teacher, Lionel Dricot, told us to work preferably on something we like and use. I was thinking of working on the [Anki project](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which I use a lot for my studies. They have two repos on GitHub:

* for [desktop computers][anki-desktop];
* for [Android devices][ankidroid].

The first one is under [AGPLv3][anki-desktop-license]. The second one is under [GNU GPLv3][ankidroid-license]. Hence both are open source.

I will check both to see on which one I will prefer working on, or if I prefer contributing to another project altogether.

Since this is a course about using open source, I am writing this report in a git repo using a MIT license. The report will be organized as a log. References will available at the end of this report.
