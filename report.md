# LINGI2401 - Open Source strategy for software development #

## 2018-09-25 ##

Today I went to the [Open Source strategy for software development][2401] class.

We have to choose an open source project we which to contribute to. The teacher, Lionel Dricot, told us to work preferably on something we like and use. I was thinking of working on the [Anki project](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), which I use a lot for my studies. They have two repos on GitHub:

* for [desktop computers][anki-desktop];
* for [Android devices][ankidroid].

The first one is under [AGPLv3][anki-desktop-license]. The second one is under [GNU GPLv3][ankidroid-license]. Hence both are open source.

I will check both to see on which one I will prefer working on, or if I prefer contributing to another project altogether.

Since this is a course about using open source, I am writing this report in a git repo using a MIT license. The report will be organized as a log. References will be available at the end of this report.

I haven't really taken the time to think about which project to contribute to. Other projects that I find interesting:

* [Exercism][exercism]
* [Firefox Focus, aka Firefox Klar][ff]
* [Rust][rust]

From the [course repo][2401], here are a few questions to ask myself:

> How to explore a project?
* Who are the people taking the decisions? (usually, the core commiters)
* What are the main communication channels? (are the deciders available on it?)
* What's the vision for the near future?
* What are the current challenges?

> How to contribute to a project?
* Start with the bug tracker: what are the "easy issues"
* Present yourself on the communication channel, ask for suggestions to "start to play with the code"
* Build the code and use your own build!
* Have a motivation: "In the end, I want to bring to this project this and that!"
* Identify controversials issues and widely discutted issues in the bug trackers
